# Troubleshooting & Debugging Log

This document records the debugging process followed during the development of the obstacle avoiding robot car.  
The goal is to systematically identify hardware and software issues and document observations and findings.

## Issue 1: Motors do not rotate

### Observation
- Robot does not move at all.
- Motors do not rotate even when movement commands are executed.
- Arduino and motor driver power LEDs are ON.

### Actions Taken
- Verified all wiring connections according to the circuit diagram.
- Ensured common ground between Arduino and motor driver.
- Checked motor driver power supply using external battery.

### Result
- No motor movement observed.

### Possible Causes
- Motor driver enable pins not correctly configured
- Incorrect Arduino pin mapping
- Insufficient current from power supply
- Faulty motor driver module

---

## Issue 2: Motor functionality verification

### Observation
- Unsure whether motors or motor driver are faulty.

### Actions Taken
- Motors tested independently using direct battery connection.
- Each motor rotated correctly when connected directly.

### Result
- Motors confirmed to be functional.

### Conclusion
- Issue likely lies in motor driver configuration or control logic.

---

## Issue 3: Motor driver control testing

### Observation
- Motors still not rotating when controlled through Arduino.

### Actions Taken
- Tested motor driver using a minimal Arduino motor test code.
- Verified enable pins (ENA/ENB) and control pin logic levels.
- Rechecked jumper settings on motor driver module.

### Result
- Motors did not rotate during test.

### Possible Causes
- Enable pins not receiving correct HIGH/PWM signal
- Incorrect control pin connections
- Motor driver internal fault

---

## Issue 4: Power supply concerns

### Observation
- Motors require higher current than Arduino can supply.

### Actions Taken
- Powered motors using external battery source.
- Confirmed Arduino GND connected to motor driver GND.

### Result
- No change in motor behavior.

### Conclusion
- Power supply likely not the primary issue.

---

## Current Status
- Motors and chassis are functional.
- Arduino board powers on correctly.
- Motor driver functionality remains uncertain.

---

## Next Debugging Steps
- Replace motor driver module for verification
- Test motor driver using alternate Arduino pins
- Use multimeter to check enable pin voltage
- Add serial debugging for pin state confirmation

---

## Notes
This troubleshooting process reflects an iterative debugging approach commonly followed in embedded systems and robotics projects.
